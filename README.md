# Website for admission test Holberton School

General
--------
When I was taking my admission test to holberton one of the tests was to create my first website without having any prior knowledge.
The page had certain guidelines to follow in terms of format and things to include.

Content information
--------
The website contains information about black and white photography.
It contains very famous images made in black and white with their respective information on where and when they were made as well as who took them.
It also contains inserts from other web pages such as [Disquis](https://blog.disqus.com), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/home) and [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/), which were part of the requirements.

Experience
---------
This project not only included research on how to write code in HTML and CSS, it also has some JavaScript code which was also a mandatory requirement.
The page and all its files were created on a remote linux server, which also forced you to understand how servers work (minimum to be able to connect and share files).
I found it a challenging and very entertaining project since it forced you to have to look for many things that you had no knowledge of and put them into practice as soon as possible since you had a week to carry out this project.
In my opinion my first website met the expectations and apparently by the school as well, since I was accepted into [Holberton School](https://holbertonschool.com) and this was one of the important parts of the admissions process
